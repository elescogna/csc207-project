# csc207-project

## 1. The problem domain
The problem domain we would like to explore is student-centered e-commerce. When in need to buy a bike or a bookshelf, or to sell a mini fridge after graduating, students always look for convenient options near campus. However, unless they personally know their client or seller, finding the right person to conclude a deal can be quite complicated. TmarkeTplace aims to takcle this problem.

## 2. Our application
TmarkeTplace is a platform where students can post announcements of what they would like to sell and find interesting deals whenever they need to buy something. The concept is similar to that od Ebay - but by students, for students!

## 3. The API

## 4. Foreseen challenges
* Very few API calls will be needed to implement this project, which might not be in line with the expectations of the course.
* Having the framework to manage payment will be challenging, and we might not be able to implement this use case within the project timeframe

[add other foreseen challenges here]
